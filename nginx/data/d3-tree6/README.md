D3.js Organization Chart
=====================

This is complete, though simple demonstration of an interactive web organization chart.

Once loaded, one particular employee will be shown with their superiors and subordinates. The motivation for not showing the full network is that it is expected to be quite large and overall insignificant. Rather we show only an initial employee and allow the user to step through their connections.

For fun, use the **animate** button
