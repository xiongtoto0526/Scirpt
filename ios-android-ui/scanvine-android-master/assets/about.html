        <P/>
        Scanvine harvests thousands of stories a day from a myriad of quality news sources, and ranks them based on how often they are shared on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn. It then identifies and promotes stories with unusually high share counts for their source, so that hit stories from less-popular sources are shown along with major stories from top news sites.
        <P/>
        Use it as a news aggregator to see what news the world is sharing, or as the "Billboard for news," scoring and ranking the Internet's most widely shared stories, authors, and sources.
